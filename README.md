# Constructor-Hangman

run "node Index.js" in your desired shell window and put your movie title memory to the test!

<img src="images/CLI.PNG" width="700" height="200">

You'll be prompted to guess the letters of the movie listed in underscores.

Think carefully before guessing a letter, this isn't Wheel of Fortune: you can't guess the entire word.

Once the word has been revealed, you can play again, or let your shell log you out.

I hope you have fun with this one! It isn't as crazy 80's as my last Hangman game, but you can still get your 80's flare on with some of these movies.. though I won't specify which ;)


Let me know if you have any questions, comments or concerns!
